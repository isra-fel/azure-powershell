## Goal

- Display the packages in a tree or forest structure, showing dependencies and sub-dependencies, clearly indicating which packages are required by others.
- Differentiate between direct dependencies (those explicitly listed in the requirements file) and indirect dependencies (those required by other packages).
- Highlight any version conflicts or mismatches between packages.
